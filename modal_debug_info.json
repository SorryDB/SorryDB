The `rfl` tactic is then used to close the goal by reflexivity, confirming that `1 + 1` indeed equals `2`. The `simp` tactic is used to simplify any remaining expressions, though in this case, it doesn't add any additional power. The `decide` tactic is used to automatically close the goal if the proof is straightforward, which it is in this case.\n\n### Breakdown\n\n1. **`norm_num`**: This tactic will simplify the expression `1 + 1` to `2`, ensuring that the numerical computation is correct.\n2. **`rfl`**: This tactic is used to confirm that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side by reflexivity. Since `1 + 1` is definitionally equal to `2`, this tactic will succeed.\n3. **`simp` and `decide`**: These tactics are used to confirm that the goal is already in its simplest form and can be decided by Lean's decision procedures. In this case, `simp` won't change anything, and `decide` will confirm that the goal is true.\n\n### Complete Lean 4 Code\n\n```lean4\ntheorem test_sorry : 1 + 1 = 2 := by\n  norm_num\n  <;> rfl\n  <;> simp\n  <;> decide\n```",
