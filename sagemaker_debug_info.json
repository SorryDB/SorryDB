        "raw_llm_response": "### Explanation and Proof\n\nThe goal is to prove that \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). This is a fundamental property of natural numbers, and Lean's `norm_num` tactic can automatically prove it. The `norm_num` tactic is a powerful tactic in Lean that can solve many numerical computations and basic arithmetic goals.\n\n### Lean 4 Proof\n\nHere is the Lean 4 code that replaces the `sorry` with a proof of \\(1 + 1 = 2\\):\n\n```lean4\ntheorem test_sorry : 1 + 1 = 2 := by\n  norm_num\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`norm_num` Tactic**: The `norm_num` tactic is used to normalize numerical expressions. It will automatically simplify \\(1 + 1\\) to \\(2\\) and verify that \\(2 = 2\\) is true. This tactic is sufficient to prove \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) because it is a basic arithmetic fact.\n\n### Complete Lean 4 Code\n\n```lean4\ntheorem test_sorry : 1 + 1 = 2 := by\n  norm_num\n```",

This is because the topology on `X` is a collection of subsets of `X` that satisfies certain axioms, including that the entire space `X` is open. \n\nHere is the proof in Lean 4:\n\n```lean\nexample : IsOpen (Set.univ : Set X) := by\n  exact isOpen_univ\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Understanding the Goal**: We need to prove that `Set.univ` is open in the topological space `X`.\n2. **Using the Definition**: In Lean, the `isOpen_univ` lemma directly states that the entire space `X` is open in any topological space `X`.\n3. **Applying the Lemma**: We simply apply the `isOpen_univ` lemma to complete the proof.\n\n### Complete Lean 4 Proof\n\n```lean\nexample : IsOpen (Set.univ : Set X) := by\n  exact isOpen_univ\n```",
