# Sorry Samples

This directory contains sample JSON files with lists of "sorry" instances for testing purposes.

## Purpose

These JSON define the precise interface between:

- The **server** (leaderboard) that provides sorry challenges
- The **client** (theorem proving model) that attempts to solve them. The output
  of the client should be a single string for each sorry, replacing the original "sorry".
